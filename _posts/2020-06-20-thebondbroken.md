It was on the edge of the harbor where the bond between father and son was broken. The stones became almost black in the pouring rain, old lady falling down in the waterway behind them. They stood in silence as he boarded the ship with his bag slung over his back. With big, soft eyes the son watched as the boat grew smaller, rain growing harder, until the ship finally disappeared hours later in the horizon far away. Jake wondered if he would have a toy waiting for him as he got home. 

Many years later, in what could perhaps be called a nostalgic flow Jake found himself there once more. This time he was smoking cigarettes, one after another. The shadow of the ship was vivid as if it could affect the water's flow and he could swear that he saw the water move aside for it as it cruised over the water. It too finally disappeared in the horizon, which was timely seeing as it was his last cigarette in the pack.

On the way back he stopped by his favorite bar that overlooked the water, filled with weary sailors & for some reason monks. He had never bothered to find out if there was a monestary nearby, or if it was just a neverending costume party. Did it really matter anyhow? They had stories that rivalled even the most hardened sailors - although it could have just as well been some hyperbole masked by the fog behind five-seven beers. 

The overseer mostly ignored the bar too. Only once or twice a week, and mostly on weekends did he pop in his balding, small head and go his usual round checking identification. Was there any purpose to it now?

On the edge of the harbor, overlooking the horizon, the bond was broken between ocean and man.
