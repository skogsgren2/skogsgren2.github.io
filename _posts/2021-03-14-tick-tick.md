Naming the necessary parts \
Of that which happened \
Is of prime importance \
On that darkened kitchen island \
The partly thawed chicken breast \
Tick, tick, tick against her breast \
The silence was too much for her then \
Naming the necessary steps to take \
Can wait yet another day

He put his hands through his hair \
And looked at his reflection in the mirror \
His feet in the tar fields \
And cigarettes dipped in sea water \
Tick, tick, tick against his heart \
The light illuminated the blackness \
And dried the tobacco up \
Smoke rises, disturbs his neighbor, for yet another day

And old Madame Aphrodite, \
Clutching the pearls of her third marriage \
Under the frosted sheets of her bed \
Her daydreams pulled her between ice and fire, \
Afternoon tea in Paris, \
Afternoon beers in Vienna, \
And the sunrise over her firstborn son. \
Tick, tick, tick her radio echoes from inside the bathroom \
Dead sounds do little to exhaust the corpses in her mind \
Especially when the living stopped caring \
About her wicked tarot cards \
Her nails tries to dig up someone from beneath her window, yet another time \

I stood unknowing beneath their windows \
And asked for Madame to turn it up \
My eardrums are shot since the accident, you should know \
Since they started praying for my soul. \
Like last year in the garden beneath the floral roof \
Where the one-eyed man looked at me \
And begged me to hear: \
*"Tick, tick, tick goes the silver screen"* \
And I couldn't help but turn away, yet again.

Now beneath the windows, 
Full of October coughs \
Crows perched on the drainpipes \
The broken images --- or reasons --- \
Fade against the eternal raindrop \
You want to hug her softly from behind; \
Show him how a broken wing can heal; \
Ring Aphrodite's doorbell with salad & Pinot Noir; \
And tell them that things will be okay. \
Tick, tick, tick screams the light from the screen \
For yet another day, reality lives through it, and not through them.
