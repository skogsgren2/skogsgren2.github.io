Naming the necessary parts \
Of the things that happened \
Is of prime importance \
On that darkened kitchen island \
Hovering over the partly thawed chicken breast \
Tick, tick, tick against her breast \
The silence was too much for her then \
Naming the necessary steps to take \
Can wait yet another day

He put his hands through his hair \
And looked at his reflection in the mirror \
His feet in the tar fields \
And cigarettes dipped in sea water \
Tick, tick, tick against his heart \
The light illuminated the blackness \
And dried the tobacco up \
Smoke rises, disturbs his neighbor, for yet another day

And old Madame Aphrodite, \
Clutching the pearls of her third marriage \
Under the frosted sheets of her bed \
Her daydreams pulled her between ice and fire, \
Afternoon tea in Paris, \
Afternoon beers in Vienna, \
And the sunrise over her firstborn son. \
Tick, tick, tick her radio echoes from inside the bathroom \
Dead sounds do little to exhaust the corpses in her mind \
Especially when the living stopped caring \
About her wicked tarot cards \
Her nails tries to dig up someone from beneath her window, yet another time

And the boy who awakens for the first time \
Once every Wednesday afternoon \
From the creation of his own delusions \
Tick, tick, tick --- metastasizing \
From the palmy beaches he spent all his time running towards \
Because, in the end, we tend to be afraid of waking up alone \
He drove into the sunset toward his own delusion \
Putting on his sunglasses --- it is too bright you see? \
It is, indeed, possible to dream it back to life in ones mind --- \
If only there was yet another day, you should smile either-way, anyhow.

And the frozen actress, by the windy ruins of the abandoned beach \
Stands alone facing treason in front of the harbinger of love, \
Of the man of her fate, almost faded \
The one created, silhouetted in her dreams \
By the sacred shadows of her heart to forget tomorrow \
Tick, tick, tick by their shared rhythm \
To sway slowly by the candlelight at 5AM \
She really, at that point, had no one to meet \
But the imagined, yet real, trip of conversation \
Between her senses, and what she would say if he was really there \
On yet another night of promises

I stood unknowing beneath their windows \
And asked for Madame to turn it up \
My eardrums are shot since the accident --- \
You should know since they started praying for my soul. \
Like last year in the garden beneath the floral roof \
Where the one-eyed man looked at me \
And begged me to hear \
Tick, tick, tick goes the silver screen \
And I couldn't help but turn away, yet again.

Now beneath the windows, \
Full of October coughs \
Crows perched on the drainpipes \
The broken images --- or reasons --- \
Fade against the eternal raindrop \

You want to hug her softly from behind; \
Show him how a broken wing can heal; \
Ring Aphrodite's doorbell with salad & Pinot Noir; \
Crush the sunglasses in your arthritic palm; \
Laugh with her against the mirror, escape to the vague sky; \

And tell them that things will be okay. \
Tick, tick, tick screams the light from the screen \
For yet another day, reality lives through it, and not through them.
