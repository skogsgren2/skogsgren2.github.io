title: The Land Of The Clouds

The land of the clouds open up before me, \
With its vast mountain ranges, \
Waterfalls that pour down to earth from gaps in-between \
And its inhabitants that wave before they explode \
I'm only here as a visitor, you see I can only handle so much \
I can only fall in love that many times \
Before I fall down and become unable to get up again \
Clouds move in layers, like a wave \
And the sun cuts through like a knife. \
I have to close my eyes, \
And when I open them up again \
Their land is closed to me. \
It disappears just as it appears 

The shadow man besides me, unfazed \
By the ground that's missing in front of him \
He looks on toward the white painted sky with a curious look on his face \
There's something to be found there, \
He knows it --- \
So he walks over the edge \
And he continues forward, floating \
On his draining shadow. \
People shout in fear, \
But it doesn't matter anyways, \
At least not to him returning to his previous existence

One day some indeterminate amount of days later \
At the train station that had just opened, about 5AM, \
I thought I saw something profound but it turned out to be a plastic bag \
Carried by the wind to some strange place \
I imagine it by the land of the clouds, acting as a sail \
To all of their bad thoughts, their minds --- \
Too, can only handle that much \
Before they pour out the sides, and never can hope to get back up again. \
To the land of the clouds, \
With its vast mountain ranges \
That one can form with your own fork.
