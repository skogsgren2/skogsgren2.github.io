title: The leaves fall gently...
---

The smells of maturity carry their reminder \\
Way past their usual echoes \\
As the leaves fall gently, \\
Red, yellow and nauseously green \\
Stain the waters and my coughs \\
Suppressed by the part of me that desires, \\
Upholds the stage to which no one returns \\

While in various moments different people \\
See different parts of me as one \\
It splits violently whenever the tide, \\
And the night turn ever so bright. \\
As the reflection of her old mirage \\
Turns itself over on the water \\
My mind is transfixed, like my eyes \\

I can see quite clearly the numerous pairs, \\
So delicate and concise as the wine \\
Its water boils to a gentle steam making me \\
Quickly lose my footing on the ancient bog \\
I try to come up with some farewell, \\
But I blank in the hall by the wall \\
By the portrait of Michelangelo and his women \\

As one day turns into the next \\
The other is quickly forgot; \\
That which was borrowed is kept \\
That sunrise is to remain in a photograph \\
Framed up against some ancient name \\
As another family yells from the television \\
That you follow without following them \\

It's funny how we always talk of the same places \\
Heaven & hell, D.C. & L.A. \\
How we brag of our farewells \\
And keep our explanations in hollowed dens \\
That are somehow supposed to be hallowed \\
By old Sir. Jesus Christ herself \\
Walter Cronkite sneezes on Live TV \\

**& God bless him!**
