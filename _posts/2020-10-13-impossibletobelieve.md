title: Impossible to believe sometimes
---

Impossible to believe sometimes \\
As the cold wind blows over greedy roofs \\
As the man in thin-rimmed spectacles \\
Decide another man's fate by sharpened crayon \\
Impossible to believe - \\
That dreams aren't bred like eggs \\

And all of those early memories \\
That were supposed to decide \\
The old retiree down the road \\
As if you had to stop yourself \\
From getting further ahead \\
Turn into a painting best kept hidden \\

The orphan emerging from emerging doorways \\
Quotes Ginsberg & Kerouac \\
In profound new ways \\

People come and go through various doors \\
As do certain versions of Michelangelo \\
His eternal women too \\
End up getting shot in dirty alleyways \\
For indicating their anger \\
In ways other than blood \\
End up sacrificing their children \\
By the sharpened silver needle \\
And regretting it as it blows \\
Through these various doors, \\
The cold wind blows from across \\
Distant nights, bouncing on tin roofs\\

To the ones who disappear below ground \\
The smoothed trip means little \\
Even if the dyed-blonde guide \\
Plucks your eyebrows for free \\
Or that those rusty old shoes \\
Are polished beyond anyone's wildest dreams. \\
