title: Impossible to believe sometimes
---

Impossible to believe sometimes \\
As the cold wind blows over greedy roofs \\
As the man in thin-rimmed spectacles \\
Decide another man's fate by sharpened crayon \\
Impossible to believe - \\
That dreams aren't bred like eggs \\

And all of those early memories \\
That were supposed to decide \\
The old retiree down the road \\
As if you had to stop yourself \\
From getting further ahead \\
The orphan emerging from emerging doorways \\
Quotes Ginsberg & Kerouac \\
In profound new ways \\

People come and go through various doors \\
Even certain versions of Michelangelo \\
His eternal women too \\
Get shot in dirty alleyways \\
For indicating their anger \\
In ways other than blood \\
For not sacrificing their children \\
By the sharpened silver needle \\
Through these various doors \\
The cold wind blows from across \\
Tin roofs in distant nights \\

To the ones who disappear below ground \\
The smoothed trip means little \\
Even if the dyed-blonde guide \\
Plucks your eyebrows for free \\
Or that those rusty old shoes \\
Are polished beyond anyone's wildest dreams. \\
