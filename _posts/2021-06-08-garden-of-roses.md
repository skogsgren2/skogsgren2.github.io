During all of this mild-mannered weather, \
As I lean against the garden of roses \
Along comes this torrent of feathers \
That tickles against my throat \
That makes me laugh, until I get sore \
At whatever I was originally waiting for. \

Particularly what I now forgot, \
A face, of that much I am certain. \
I too see his front door --- \
Massive green painted oak; \
And the fingers that dance along the irony \
Of my existence. \
At least it was accompanied by the tones of his voice. 

First I attempted to bypass it \
By appealing to the notion of a dream --- \
Then I turned toward the bottle. \
After that Walt Whitman, Ginsberg & Kerouac \
They too lost the battle, you see they couldn't cross \
The river of Styx without a single feather \
So, I turned toward the marble creature \
That lingers in my hallway --- \
Who screeched whenever I slept peacefully content \
And who wanders across the endless seas. \
He was unsure of what to answer to my question \
So he gave up by appealing to Mr.Freud & his mother \
Leaving me all covered in these feathers. 

But don't fret. \
The sun shines on my face as I lean against the garden of roses. \
The light bounces against the ripples on the water.
