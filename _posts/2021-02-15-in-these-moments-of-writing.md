title: In These Moments Of Writing

**I**

Rowdy evening canceled out \
By empty smells pouring in from the window: \
She tied up her heart about his feet, \
Those dirty scraps and so full of fears \
She grabbed his face between her hands \
And echoed the notes of time \
That resumes, after an ocean of waiting.

But never would he wake up \
He could only doze off \
To *'La vie en rose'* \
--- Momentarily --- \
He flickered against his reflection \
In her eyes, in her tears \
Just so empty, except for the fear

Then as morning awoke once again \
And death, as usual, clasped the pen \
Pouring black ink onto the page \
He, remembering the reflection, \
Wrote of memories as the dead \
The sparrows hardly understood, \
Sitting along his bed's edge.

**II**

Sometimes you have reminiscence \
Of those thoughts from dark crevices \
Who can ever forget those nocturnal smells? \
Or those cries of hysteria pounding \
From those booths of damp souls \
You sway in the wind to obtain the key \
For an evening of aimless dreaming

For how softly we tread on alone \
On that hard, crumbling stone \
When nothing to us is offered \
Except the maps to the unknown \
We whisper those dying breaths \
In some inane, desperate attempt to say \
That we were never once afraid.

Like so the memory comes and goes \
Through distant possibilities \
Through close-by fears \
Through cold-air nights \
Through warm & sunny days \
Through them all a haze of smoke & beer \
Like so the memory comes and goes through purgatory

And then under candlelight \
Rambling of where she died and how \
You burn brighter than your silence; \
Of course! I shouldn't have to say so: \
But shortly after you die --- \
The silence in heaven does not abide, it shouts. \
I observe you, I am obsessed with myself

**III**

Now I stand alone however, \
Held only by my weathered name, \
Recognizing that the weight we carry; \
Empty dreams, empty memories \
And empty picture frames; \
Always has been, and always will remain \
Love, and only love.

For who can deny that waiting? \
It will return, no matter how ill at ease. \
You may to yourself write a paper \
About all the masquerades, \
But you'll hear the distant drum calling \
From one hopeful look from across the room. \
The world revolves around such moments

I wiped my mouth from some suds \
As I looked across the crowded hall \
My heart renewed her memory \
As she met my eyes and walked over --- \
Smiled, a little bit fuzzy I admit \
Yet undeniably certain in a way \
In regards to the moon coming in from the window

Later, leaning against wall on floor \
Quiet dancing around who's turn it was to approach \
--- Us who occupy life's various corners \
We who find the twisted apple branch \
Among angels roaming summery avenues alone --- \
This remains how I think when time stands still, \
As she lowers herself down to me on the floor.

---

Suddenly I am awakened by a bang \
And the ultimate secret withers away \
And so I continue on with that day, \
I'm tired of wondering what it is, still I persist \
Yet still a face, a smile, nothing more remains \
But that is not true, and I know so; \
It is everything: a face, a smile --- and nothing more.

(In these moments of writing, have you forgotten? When I think back on the moment as I sit here with my pen, will they be dreams or will they be real? What ideas, then, will remain?)
