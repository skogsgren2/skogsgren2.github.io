**I**

Rowdy evening canceled out \
By empty smells pouring from the window: \
She ties up her heart about his feet, \
Those dirty scraps and so full of fears \
She grabs his face between her hands \
And echoes the notes of time \
That resumes, after an ocean of waiting \

But never would he wake up \
He could only doze off \
To *'La vie en rose'* \
--- Momentarily --- \
He flickered against his reflection \
In her eyes, in her tears \
Just so empty, except for the fear \

Then as morning awoke once again \
And death, as usual, clasped the pen \
Pouring black ink onto the page \
He, remembering the reflection, \
Wrote of memories as the dead \
The sparrows hardly understood, \
Sitting along his bed's edge. \

**II**

Sometimes you have reminiscence \
To those thoughts from dark crevices \
Who can ever forget those nocturnal smells? \
Or those cries of hysteria pounding \
From those booths of damp souls \
You sway in the wind to obtain the key \
For an evening of aimless dreaming \

In the depths of a bus terminal \
Among the maniacs tipping their hats \
To beggars holding out their hands \
In the punch-holes of childhood homes \
Among all the wooden toys --- \
And sounds of screaming \
That part of life is lost, forever.

Like so the memory comes and goes \
Through distant possibilities \
Through close-by fears \
Through cold-air nights \
Through warm & sunny days \
Through them all heavy smoke & beer \
Like so the memory comes and goes \

And then under candlelight \
Rambling of where she died and how \
You burn brighter than your silence; \
Of course! I shouldn't have to say so: \
But shortly after you die --- \
The silence in heaven does not abide, it shouts. \
I observe you, I am obsessed with myself \

**III**

Now I stand alone however, \
Held only by my weathered name, \
Recognizing that the weight we carry; \
Empty dreams, empty memories \
And empty picture frames; \
Always has been, and always will remain \
Love, and only love. \

For who can deny that waiting? \
It will return, no matter how ill at ease \
You may to yourself write a paper \
About all the masquerades \
Still it will all fade, like fate, like name \
In one look from across the room \
The world revolves around such moments \

I wiped my mouth from some suds \
Looking across the crowded hall \
My heart renewed her memory \
As she met my eyes and walked over --- \
Smiled, a little bit fuzzy I admit \
Yet undeniably certain in a way \
In regards to the moon coming in from the window \

Later, leaning against wall on floor \
Quiet dancing around who's turn it was to approach \
--- Us who occupy life's various corners \
We who find the twisted apple branch \
Among angels roaming summery avenues alone --- \
This remains how I think when time stands still \
As she lowers herself down to me on the floor \

Suddenly I am awakened by a bang \
And all I knew instantly withers away, \
The ultimate secret of the universe \
And so I continue on with my day, \
Yet still a face, a smile, nothing more remains \
But that is not true, and I know so: \
It is everything: a face, a smile --- and nothing more. \

(In these moments of writing, have you forgotten? When I think back on the moment as I sit here with my pen, will they be dreams or will they be real?)
