title: On the road paved in diamond & gold

There's a road paved in diamond & gold \\
Where it's impossible to follow along \\
But the king sits patiently \\
Studying the cracks glimmering in the moonlight \\
Waiting for his princess to return \\

By day it is a most ordinary road \\
Where men laugh and speak of their ordinary dreams \\
And distant seas and meets and fleets \\
That all can occupy every kingdom in a heartbeat \\
Yet they wait for their reality to return \\

By the lantern light in the tavern \\
The king occupies his regular seat by the corner row \\
As two men approach him with a proposition, \\
Seeing through his disguise they say honestly: \\
*"Are you waiting for her or for yourself to return?"* \\

There is a road paved in diamond & gold \\
That eventually leads to a broken home \\
Where she sits waiting alone on her knees \\
Hands tied together as if she had been told \\
That it would eliminate the word and replace it with return. \\
