title: The Old Grass Fields Are Burning

The old grass fields are burning \
The wintery soul is walking by \
A young cat stretching outside your window \
He watches, quietly, most reflectively \
There's a most interesting turn to his step \
To the way he thinks before he moves. \
All of this in the space of a moment \
That reminds you of how much you've really lost \

And most people are nothing but reflections \
Of the mirror they bought at the antique shop long ago \
It hangs over their door \
With a black frame \
And crackly, shiny surface \
With nothing in it but storm clouds \
If you squint towards the backdrop. \

The old grass fields are burning \
The summer begins to come by for afternoon tea & biscuits \
But the cat remains on the edge of your windowsill \
It stretches and yawns \
It looks at you as if to make you superstitious \
That there in fact is more than you could ever speak \
The devil with no lie of separation \
Preaches the gospel of God, \
And merges once more.
