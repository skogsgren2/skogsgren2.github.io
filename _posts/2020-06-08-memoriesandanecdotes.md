title: Memories & Anecdotes
---
Maybe it was to be after how it was commissioned \\
The hysterical, unhinged anger rising from our feet \\
They claimed madness in the face of impending corruption, \\
Yet they willingly ignored the corrosion - instead opted to complain \\
To get someone to speak to, to be expelled for speaking its name \\
To have your brain open in the stream of raw passion \\
Was pushed down until we started questioning if we could breath \\

The loving energy looking in; unshowered dancing to Sam Cooke \\
Moaning in pleasure in all your dreams; messy rooms & books in disarray \\
Pure love running through the veins of the unconscious \\
Before the window she runs liberated; under full moon \\
Memories & anecdotes as she passed the traffic light \\

The subway emptied long ago, the one who recited battered poems \\
Sat in silence overlooking the mercy of the cleansing storm \\
No need to get involved if we all are swept up like Noah \\
All that you need is self-confidence & poisoned words \\
When all of this is over, the machine is still fastened, \\
Tightly knit along their synapses, mouth blabbering, \\
Light turned off long ago. \\
