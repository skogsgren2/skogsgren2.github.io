title: Fat snowflakes tumbling down
---

Fat snowflakes tumbling down \\
Troubling news, tomorrow will come \\
Yet, the possibilities seem so endless now \\
Why and how o I want it to end? \\

A place that I've never been to before \\
Still seems like home \\
The rhythm of ancient drums  \\
hollow against my response to even slight pain \\

Does it matter that playgrounds full of rust \\
Gather outside your door \\
Does it matter that we've never met before \\
Your mother certainly seems to think so \\

Now the sun is setting \\
perhaps the snowflakes are more beautiful \\
in this way - maybe \\
I shall never be alone \\
