title: A Lullaby

Goodbye to these capricious moments, \
To these predictable outcomes, \
Of the things that we create. \
There's no need for anything, \
But the exhaling of the burdens \
That we have created by association with the devil. \
There's no need to say goodbye to them, \
But goodbye to you, to what I wish for you \
How I wish your future \
Be a future, and not another name.

Goodbye to the people, \
That were always too afraid \
And those who couldn't understand it. \
I occupy someplace in-between \
The rhythm pities me. \
This is my lullaby, sung as the angels are falling. \
Can I ever hope to perform something else?
