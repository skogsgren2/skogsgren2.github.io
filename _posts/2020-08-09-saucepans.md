title: A thousand differently shaped saucepans
---

A thousand differently shaped saucepans \\
Lined up in chronological order \\
Someday, maybe, you'll fondly remember \\
Worthless moments like this \\
As you pack your lifetime in your trunk \\

That time once a week in church \\
He was actually telling the truth \\
The coldness of strangers \\
Comes back as the flames on the ground \\
The volcanic fumes of January \\
Was only the beginning of breathing problems \\
Brewing up from above \\

Early last night the child we wished we had \\
Gaunt cheeks, lying on his back \\
The blue-eyed son of blood-red rivers \\
Gasped as he took air for the last time \\
He might've muttered under his breath \\
But the only witness was a falling star \\
And the crackle of his half-lit cigarette \\
We couldn't help but cry as we passed \\
On our way to the imitation of normality \\
Along a thousand saucepans \\
Lined up in chronological order \\

Miles away from the real shore \\
Thorns lining the water below \\
Something tells me, \\
It won't be that long before we fall down \\
Even though the ships wave red, white and blue \\
And the sky screams clear \\
The river of rubber dyed in blood \\
The ghosts of a thousand mistakes \\
In bodies lined up in chronological order \\
Inspires no ones' hope \\
Except for the most desperate \\
And hopefully that is all it really takes \\
