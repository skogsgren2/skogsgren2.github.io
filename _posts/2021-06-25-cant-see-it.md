title: Not showing anything
layout: post
---

There's no respite to my own mind \
I'm looked into a cage, \
And it haunts me every day \
I now sit among loved friends, \
The best of friends, \
With good drink and food \
Laughing as we sit perusing \
Over all the minute details \
Of our shared lives, yet \
As soon as the sound is turned down \
It returns as I stare at the setting sun \
I'm too far away to change it \
All I can do is watch and pretend that I'm okay \
By not showing anything \
If I can't see it, does it even exist?

And as the newly sprouted children \
Inquire into the world around them, \
Am I to lie, either to myself or to them? \
If I was honest the relationship \
Wouldn't be able to be repaired \
So I make it up, hide it behind some name. \
I thought I saw the birds between the trees, \
But it was only further evidence \
For my upkept illusion, the act, \
Of picturing that it's just a mistake \
By not showing anything \
If I can't see it, does it even exist?

And in conversation with the man \
Who's already died twice, \
But who is terrified of not being remembered \
Long after he's gone \
And all I can do is sit there and nod \
That is what is expected from me \
ANd I can't help but agree at that time \
As the last rays of the sun hits my face \
Anything else is only torture \
To that tormented soul \
That never learned to inquire about itself \
He's thirsty for all of the sodium, \
Wants to be reassured by pure water \
When I'm gone there will be nothing, \
Will it even exist then? \
Will I be mourned, or congratulated \
On my eventual reintegration?

While it might sound like a painting, \
Or some big impressionistic lie --- \
Understand that I'm only attempting to see people without their names \
And see how it is possible to go on without interpretation \
Shed from the layers that we possess \
There's a different country that switches \
As the day turns into night, \
And I sit here by myself, \
Unsure of my place in the world \
I can taste the safety in my memories \
In the unchanging passion of my ego \
That takes place in my dragging shadow \
All I can do is sit and watch, \
Pretending that I'm okay --- \
By not showing anything, \
If I can't see it, does it exist? \
I'm not so sure anymore. \
It seems intensely familiar to me --- \
The sun sets as it rises, \
With no one there to supervise it \
Without anything to forget, \
But the forgetting.
