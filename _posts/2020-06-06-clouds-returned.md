title: Clouds - Returned
---

In the bustling dining room whose posters cried tears from Stalin's cradle \\
Tobacco smoke in clouds over the stained oak booths dispersed \\
by the gentle movement of the servant-girl \\
Bringing smells of comfort in the way of frying oil and perfumed neck \\
The laughs from mustached gentlemen in the next booth along with \\
the kid beating his potato to a starchy pulp \\
Overpowered the memory as the clouds of stale tobacco returned, \\
in any case I would prefer it to be French. \\

In another world I was content and still. \\
I owned a motorcycle, and thundered down the road \\
Slavery is wrong in any form and was stopped by brave men \\
Would I dare ride the motorcycle in a downpour? \\
These days I don't even dare to think in those terms. \\

Two shots of gasoline and then I headed home \\
Big clouds emerged as I opened the door to the empty street \\
Boots clicked against asphalt \\
Birds greeted the morning \\
A motorcycle wizzed past \\
The clouds up above were something I couldn't get out of my head \\
