title: \'Never Again\' Once More

**I**

I walk along the interconnected grid of streets \
Looking for answers among the intersubjective dream \
Past closed bookshops \
Past occupied bars of winter old \
Past doctors tending wounded workers \
Past the child in tears \
The haze occupies this red rock --- \
And for that I am afraid

But, granted, what would it be without all the people? \
Any shadow has its yellow moon \
And even though I would never say it \
I'm grateful. and I'll show you how

The first window, and scene is that of the mother \
That grasps the cane at twilight \
And goes along with our charades \
Even if we've all forgotten it \
You who stare at photographs \
As if their golden idols \
And gateways to some other place \
Your lullaby's eternal, your name transcends your fame

Drink to your second person at some wintery moon \
The Jester, wearing a powder blue wig \
Who lets it flow from him yo you, and from the masters to his face \
He smiles, of course, against the bastard \
Who punches him right in the face \
And he just answers by whistling a tune \
As I watch, and try to find myself \
In that virtuous, smokey haze

And now leaning against the wall, the forlorn traveler \
Who told tales of countries from far away; \
Where misty mountains rained gold down below \
Where the children stood as living billboards \
Where coral reefs where replaced by plastic \
Where baboons played guitar for laughter \
And where up was down, and blood was water \
And money wasn't worth anything more \
Than what you did for your neighbor \
And the value of love transcends that of hatred \
He smokes, certainly, but will live longer than the rest of us \
He loves us, but is blinded, for forgetting is a virtue \
In the world of walking

Further down, blisters on his torn skin --- leaning over the grate on the floor \
Telemachus sits and tries to see where it leads \
Inhales that exhaust of false promises \
The master of our domain \
From that starting point will always lose everything \
But can one really blame him? \
The Gods are supposedly benevolent, \
And where history once went, \
Then must it not go there once more? \
Everybody reassures him that everything will be alright \
But the hot air is enthralling --- and the blinking green light even more so

**II**

The door will close \
And intersubjectivity to be replaced \
By singularity

What was once black & white \
Will once again erase the blot of ink \
On the eternal white page

Someday I might become myself \
But try to imagine that place \
And quickly lose yourself

**III**

I walk along the street \
Of 'never again' once more \
It is raining, of course, \
And they laugh at me \
For searching for you again \
On this Friday evening

The riders going past me \
Are kidding themselves with their lives of steel \
Burying themselves in various degrees of nothingness \
I dress myself in horns & blood \
And stick myself with the knife \
For the remote possibility of tomorrow

Tomorrows are sold by the dozen \
In the form of jelly rolls \
And purple velvet drapes. \
The judge can only look as deep \
As her eyes can see \
Words bounce off the waterline  

In the Christmas sale \
The skeletons dance to the tune \
Of their bones jangling in 3/4 time \
As I walk past and mumble 'never again' \
The night vibrates and nothing, \
Nothing is just dark enough \
To wrap up this song of faces
