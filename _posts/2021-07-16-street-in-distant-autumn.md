To be needed, and to need someone back \
To walk the razor's edge of schizophrenia \
Is my, and your reality --- \
Portrayed, nay, reflected in our image \
Yet I stumble at the sight of your face, \
And mine, as we go astray. \
I'd like to picture our meeting: \
There's a parade that we ignore, \
Fake fanciful things never interested us anyways, \
I might dismiss my friends, and work, for an hour \
You might dismiss yours, not that any of it matters \
As we sit smoking cigarettes --- \
In the rising sun out your open window. \
No, what matters is the need. \
The attraction between north & south, \
East & westbound have no place here.

A photograph, a single video frame --- \
Of heat, and memory, and ink, \
All reverberate into a vivid dream: \
A facsimile of your face. \
Like a peeping Tom I assemble the pieces, \
I want to get near, only, \
I realize far too late, \
My version of you isn't you:
It's me, gazing into a mirror. \
The street is empty now, \
The ink pours onto the ancient stone, \
Just for my amusement, you should know, \
And of course, for my imagined pain.
