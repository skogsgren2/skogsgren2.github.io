title: The stick outlining the shape in the wood
---

The stick outlining the shape in the wood \\
Picked out of the deadwood drifting in with the shapes of the moon \\
Shaped by the sands of time through a cruel world \\
By man shaped into a crescent, by man forgot. \\

You might remember the times of death \\
That suddenly came rolling in, one time \\
In the beginning, losing count by the fifth \\
The train in the distance, \\
On the platform by the woman in high heels \\
You might try to take the wheel \\
Thundering down the highways of Mexico \\
But no matter what, \\
You're not coming back from this. \\

One of the same, two opposites \\
Joined together by the hip \\
Some say by necessity, but the groovy ones \\
Could spot the singularity from a mile away \\

The thing that stayed with you, \\
On that beach in November, \\
Outlining the shapes of letters \\
Was not the way that people moved \\
But in what ways you were supposed to remember \\
All the alibies, all the real tears. \\
I mean what hope was there, \\
When I couldn't even remember who I was \\
When you gathered together \\
To ride out the storm \\
In the wave of what would be a powerful memory. \\

A white flower offered in innocence \\
Over the last supper of youth \\
In one fell sweep that illusion was destroyed \\
Replaced by "reality" or whatever you might fear \\
Of everything in front of your possibilites \\

In one moment you might pray for forgivness  \\
In one moment you might forget the decision \\
The morals that will lay heavy on a grave \\
By the mist of heavy achings \\
And desires aching in the dawn. \\

Its funny how the wind blows through us, in exactly the same way \\
When we try to find out the dark rhythm, \\
The lonely feeling trying to guide us \\
Always stands up and says to us \\
To come back in a little while. \\
