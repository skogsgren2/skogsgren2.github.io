title: In the back of the nostalgic bar
---

In the back of the nostalgic bar \\
Through the veil of purple haze \\
She would wait as if in a trance \\
She would smile, of course \\
Talking about words in wrong places \\
The sirens going past outside \\
In shy moonlight --- \\
Is buried along the drained rain \\
What could she ever hope to gain? \\

Though most would admit it was romantic \\
Playful toying with disguised words \\
Sunsets, sunrise at bustling docks \\
Tobacco filled rooms --- \\
The doctor might fill the cup \\
In the bar as she entered \\
Through polemic words from a priest \\
That she threatened, as you normally do \\
I mean, what else was there to do? \\

At the corner of the busy street \\
Among the Greek gods by the mount \\
Among the homeless peddling flowers \\
Among the trash of yesterdays woes \\
She dances without a care in the world \\
The driver tries to come up with another name \\
But keeps on drinking from his cup \\
During the lighting of the lights \\
Would she realize her own reflection? \\

So in comes the wrong guy \\
At the wrong time by the road \\
Flows in his words, his ancient tattoos \\
That puts a curse on lost eyes \\
Looking in from the window \\
She stared at the pattern --- \\
At her own implied lifelessness \\
She that held it in her hands \\
And how long ti'll she regains it? \\

Her death might be romantic \\
If there was any hope for the rest of us \\
For everyone except King Lear \\
Or those without any confidence \\
Those drifting forlorn at midnight \\
Loneliness could be solved \\
Using some scientific machine \\
Kept in deep below our elbows \\
And how long ti'll we regain it? \\
