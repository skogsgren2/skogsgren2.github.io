title: The entryway to heaven is a gate made out of thorns
---
The entryway to heaven is a gate made out of thorns \\
Making a print out of its shadow on your back \\
As the door to the first bar closes behind you \\
Through the sultry air the vision grows dimmer \\
Your face grows more unknown \\

The mother with an empty stroller \\
Goes shadowless in the streets at noon \\
Like pennies are to spare change, \\
Her thoughts feel like zeroes in a binary world \\

On the floor of the supermarket \\
Lies a discarded apple from some place around the world \\
Some children look curiously at the decomposed fruit \\
That fell to the ground one Paradise ago \\

The king of unclaimed art museums \\
Shouts down the avenue of what he was allowed to see \\
He writes in his free time as a hobby \\
But it grew larger, ti'll there was nothing else \\
To ever hope to talk about \\

The entryway is somewhere down the road \\
In the dark shadows of the opposite \\
That you ever could hope to be \\
Search for the meaning in the city \\
With no discernible roads \\
