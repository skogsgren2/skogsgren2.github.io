title: Long-forgotten, yet, yet...

In moments of contemplation, \
Empty of all desires \
Find my love reigning \
By the controls of the marionette that dangles \
From the roof, and while I may ramble \
Yet, yet I call for the truth \
From that broken wing, \
Far above that long-forgotten heart \

In the spring her name echoes,\
That fatal name of violent water \
Dripping from neglected pipes, \
From that foreign touch \
By the early rays \
Of that long-forgotten spring \
While I'm still alone and I keep calling \
Nor tears, or fears flow toward you \

In that land on which you dwell, \
*(Pencil high in your hand)* \
Call me dead before I undress \
I don't know what you understand, nor do I want to \
I want to be loved, unlike you \
Shrines are there for faith and not for fame \ 
The rivers flows for you, but only in blood \
While I walk up to you, still, \ 
I only walk up to you in sad relief \
As it pours down my neck, cold drops and fever \
