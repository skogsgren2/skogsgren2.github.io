title: From A Hospital Waiting Room

The woman dancing to the first fall of snow, \
Blue eyes, blonde hair, \
An image paints its landscape \
There is fever, that partly melts it \
There's a treasure in the locks of her hair.

I try to convince her \
That my existence brings about \
Wild winds, sugar storms \
There's doubt, there's the trail \
Leading down the road.

It plays the notes \
That I'm perpetually afraid of \
They echo those Styxian drums \
I sweat profusely but I haven't even started yet \
Descending from the castle high above.

And as I sit alone by the table \
Of youth's expected banquet \
I dream of distant cigarettes, \
Of Lilith, of relief \
From this dream of Penelope.

The road crumbles beneath my feet, \
It's made of Roman stones \
Made a long, long, time ago. \
A face sculpted into the pattern I see in them \
That face I see when I'm alone.

As it thunders from the mount \
I can't help but be a little bit excited \
But most importantly I'm afraid \
Of seeing the multiheaded hydra, \
Once again, after defeating it.

The summer wind blows on, \
And all that I have left are remnants \
Of the retrospective future memory \
That I archive someplace below. \
I am Adam, Able & Abraham.

The earth is shaking to my hands, \
It shivers, I am released \
From its undulating cycle. \
While I'm not special in any way \
That face sings to me from the CRT in the corner of the waiting room.
