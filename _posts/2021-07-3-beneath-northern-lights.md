I walk with my friend up the mountain \
We sit on pointed rocks with our thick wool blanket \
And unpack our food: \
Our cheese, baguettes and --- \
Most importantly --- \
Our bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon \
We enjoy ourselves as we \
Watch the sun go down \
The ground goes quickly from being lit \
By a map of foreign constellations \
To darkness that envelops \
The nether valley beneath the moon \
Where we came from, once. 

And while it is tempting to comment \
--- That our bread is moldy; \
That our cheese has transformed \
Into a feral nest of worms; \
That our wine turned to vinegar --- \
It would only tarnish this tender moment \
His skeleton is too brittle for the emotional shock, \
Let alone his soul floating around \
The nether valley beneath the moon, \
That we once called home. 

The gentle greeting of spring gives rise to universal repose \
By the angelic choir of mocking birds and blackcaps \
The illusion of life is a promise, and not a belief \
The young wolf cub discovers the world \
As something pristine, and he is its master \
He's been whispered the words in his ears, \
Knowing, and not believing, that the discovery \
In fact goes both ways. \
The nether valley beneath the moon \
Discovers the wolf cub.

The silent, cold embrace of summer \
That dries out even the most stoic of men \
No tears are wasted, but sometimes one can't help oneself \
Shadows dance across abandoned deserts \
Caves becomes an aphrodisiac \
Despite lacking a source of water \
All they need is vinegar dripping from the stalagmites \
As the nether valley beneath the moon \
Cracks beneath death's bony grip.

But, simply, a landscape now before us \
Of wasted autumn leaves \
That are eaten by various insects \
Or floated over the souls below \
That eventually land in the ocean \
Outlining the nether valley beneath the moon \
Otherwise the world would explode.

And when the winds finally \
Tell the story of sleep \
Without a hint of cruel malintent \
Find life doing what death does best, \
Rest, which is itself a mighty test \
Civilizations fell in its name \
Relationships surely have dwelt \
In its comfortable mist \
All I know is that we sit \
Overlooking the dark remnants \
Sometime at midnight \
After much time has passed. \
Our blanket has withered \
And our flesh has blown away like dust \
Gentle, heavy snowflakes fall \
On the statues of our bones \
They tell a story to me, \
And another to the one that finds me.
