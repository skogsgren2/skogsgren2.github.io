Even in the last goodbyes, among all the small talk in the terminal - there is bittersweet solace in every word. As they say *'let her fend for herself'*, among a sea of sunbathed mustached wolves. Or as she would say: *'friends to be made'*. If any of them are to be right it seems a reconciliation needs to be made. Her mother's hair smelled of her usual shampoo as she hugged her. Lavender, or saudade. They're both the same. She must've brought it along, that little of piece of home that remains.

Along empty beaches and empty memories, as the wind brushes her hair over her face, a thought hits her. I am here. I am home. I am in the realm of unlimited potential. I am in the world of my dreams. The wind blows warm over her face and her linen tunic waves in its rhythm. Memories get filled up with empty ideas and pictures of smells and the feeling of hair in your eyes on a perfect day.

Weeks go by and everyday fears of old get replaced by new ones. Rain enters through faulty windows and the sky turns gray. The sun peeks through sometimes and evaporates any leftover rain; yet, her fear, her dreams? In her memories they seem so distant, so surreal. In the present the homeless guitarist screams at her when she passes hoping not only for a coin or two, but something more somber indeed. Rain doesn't dry up in one day.

She could return to the land of the fairy. Where gnomes make parlor tricks out of napkins and ducks play chess with their beaks against beavers playing with their elbows full of callouses. Where night is day and the sun only rises for those with ashen skin. Her parents might hug her when she arrives, but it won't be the same.

Memories change as people whistle different tunes. As the neighbor goes out for a walk. As the first snow in a decade falls in heavy snowflakes on tin roofs. She wanders by in wonder with her gray hair cut short. It blows in the icy wind without bothering her eyes nor nose. The air is free from any smell, except for that familiar faint burning. Even in the first greeting there is sadness now.
