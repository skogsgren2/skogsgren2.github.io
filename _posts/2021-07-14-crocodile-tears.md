title: Crocodile tears
---

To see it reflected in the water, \
Yet being unable to reach it \
With vision or by physical excursion, \
To be relegated to its trailing shadow, \
Seeing it far above in the sky, \
In the sun rising in the east, \
All leaves me with a crocodile's tears. 

I go to search the wide world \
For the lady with a strawberry handkerchief, \
She that is able to hold a clammy hand \
As death arrives on his white horse, \
And claims us both for his own house. \
Where the sun perpetually shines \
On our perfect reflections.

Where churches are built with old money, \
I don't have anything to put on the casket \
Except for the dandelion I picked \
In my shoddily tended garden. \
Roses arrive in the delayed winter \
To congratulate me for my earth, \
Apparently the chemical make up is good. 

What if the little children I meet on the road \
Were told the truth --- \
That the snake around their feet \
Is the harbinger of mercury tears, \
And that it doesn't matter if they run away \
For a snake he's quick, you see, \
Because he's lonely, and he can't be alone.
