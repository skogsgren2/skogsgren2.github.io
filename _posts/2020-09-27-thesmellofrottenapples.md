title: The smell of rotten apples
---

The smell of rotten apples \\
In the last rays of an escaping sun \\
Reflect in the blond curls of women \\
That compare themselves to historical Madonnas \\
In groups of five on each saddle on different horses \\
That everyone wanted once upon a time in a much different place \\
Of simple love and simple woes \\

In the reflection of the waves, whipped up to an opaque foam \\
That almost reaches the edge of the concrete quay \\
Porcelain in her tears \\
For there is no redemption in regretful screams \\
The wave always returns to shore, anyhow \\

Some speak of a highway, some speak of a boat \\
Some fondly tell stories of heroes with pointed swords \\
But what they really want to find is that everlasting home \\
Where fears are accepted, wishes non-existent \\
The Madonna & Elvis curl up together \\
One bright, warm, Friday afternoon \\

What they reward you for believing \\
Is that there is always someone waiting \\
To reciprocate those nervous twitches \\
That occur where fairy tales intertwine \\
With the reality that somehow quickly comes around \\
Who could ever be such a freak?  \\
