We'd get drunk again and whisper \\
About what we are afraid will lose its place \\
We take the game too seriously anyways, \\
As the hours go by we can't help but smile \\
Alone, yes, obviously - dropping ashes by our feet \\
In the darkened room by the weary dream \\
I ask him *"What is it that which I owe?"* \\
He turns and walks out my door, leaving us alone \\
By the newly printed picture frames and old \\
The face that haunts me tricks its shadow \\
Out from its murky street \\
Her voice is sweet and low \\
Her smell is roses and newly fallen oak \\
Her warmth crackles in its intrinsic glow \\
I like to think that she's delicate \\
But I mistake her for my reflection \\
That somehow, always, takes her place \\
So we whisper, so we blink, so we breathe \\

Then, sometime by the hall an unexpected call \\
That shuts open doors forevermore \\
Voices that tell me of the world \\
Start to echo in the faces of bearded men \\
Everything changes someone, but why, \\
this time, did it have to be me? \\
We'd get drunk again and whisper \\
About what we fear will gain \\
From this unexpected flux in the internal status-quo \\
We have much to learn from every living soul \\
Yet we are afraid of everyone \\
Who doesn't cry in exactly the same way \\
Like ourselves - as you stand and hum \\
In the elevator by one reminiscent \\
Of that ancient voice, from a dream, \\
From a very distant telephone \\
You try to make sense of the whole picture \\
You give up, get drunk, have a cigarette \\
Blow it out as your face grows old \\

And tune out \\
