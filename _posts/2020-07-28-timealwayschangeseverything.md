title: Time always changes everything
---

He sat, down on his luck, under blue skies
Time changes everything
Let the memories of his hometown
Carry him to the place where time stands still

I stand unknowing to pain beneath her window
If the roses could carry me up they would
The ships coming in through the bay down the road
Bellowed heavy moans throughout the room

The liquor taste sweet on my tongue
As you peek out your head and smile
My line did not need to be spoken
So I just sit still and you appear before me

There is no regrets as the rain arrives
Only laughter and the bellow of ships echo
Across the unpristine waterline
In the horizon the skies turn blue

We both said reckless things at times,
But time always changes everything
I think I know the smile, -
Seeing that it was the last time

He could walk by himself now
Holding onto his fleeting happiness
Once upon a time he would've moved on
But time always changes everything.
