On that morning the keys of the piano \
Played themselves into an instant memory \
The moment danced along my fingers \
Which in turn only danced to the tune itself \
Quickly I wrote it down and marveled upon completion \
My life's work, it is done! Finished before myself

During the day I walked around \
The cold distant streets of Edinburgh \
And I, with no hope nor health \
Awaited my companion, patiently. \
She was set to arrive by the evening train, \
But oh to my horror as I passed the station: \
'Delayed' it said, and by a whole day! \
Just like the fifth note of my melody.

So I begin walking home. \
While the streets had once been a mystery, \
Which in fact had once inspired parts of my melody, \
They now only carried the notes of monotony. \
There were railroad workers, railroad tycoons, \
And of course the bartenders and the bar patrons, \
Don't forget the patrons of the street bar too, \
But neither of them had anything to say, \
Opting to reflecting their own names \
Into mirrors, eyes and the bottom of bottles \
The ocean is always still that far down. 

I linger in my observations, especially how it blends \
Harmoniously with the notes of my meticulous melody \
Yet I remain restrained, because \
What use is it if no one hears it too? \
My life's work isn't mine, it is others.
