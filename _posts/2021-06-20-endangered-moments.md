To the endangered moments that flicker in the dark, \
That arise out of a splinter \
And turns into a flower \
Only to wither \
In the span of the moment, \
The distant present, \
I walk away as if to gather \
It all up in a picture \
So that I could explain it.

Explain how the wolf turns \
To me in the dark and \
Smiles with his teeth that glistens. \
Explain how the fire that was given \
Is taken away so forcefully \
By myself as I watch my own reflection \
Explain how the basement is ruled by those we pity \
Those powerless fairies and ogres \
That ache, while most gather before the reckoning \
Armed with swords that spew fire \
That burn steadily against that familiar flicker.

I am sitting, drunk, by my window \
High up from the ground \
The breeze breathes, \
My ears listen, \
I wiggle in place \
The soundtrack pounds, it whispers.
