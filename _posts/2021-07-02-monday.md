title: The Place We Call Monday

Hogland scur, gristle and womblay \
Stray the viny path toward Monday \
The woodland circus where we gather to sing, \
To play and to dance --- \
Where we sing the songs that the king has written, \
And ask for our own autographs afterwards. 

The circus is ancient and crumbling \
The servants are mothers and fathers \
They swipe the knotty floor \
Of moss, grass and spleenwort \
Before they open \
The place we call Monday. 

The angels gather in its rows \
Of rattling pine benches \
With bouquets that they picked along the way \
Of red archangel, thistle and comfrey \
And they clap at the burning sage \
Accidentally lit by the weary father. \
Deviation, to Monday, --- \
Is Monday's true name, anyhow.
