title: The Place We Call Monday
layout: post

Hogland scurr, gristle and womblay \
Stray the viny path toward Monday \
The woodland circus we're we gather to sing, \
To play and to dance --- \
We're we play the king's self-written songs to his face, \
And ask for our own autographs after in tears. 

The circus is ancient and crumbling \
The servants are mothers and fathers \
They swipe the knotty floor \
Of moss, grass and spleenwort. \
Before they open \
The place we call Monday. 

The angels gather in its rows \
Of rattling pine benches \
With bouquets that they picked along the way \
Of Red Archangel, thistle and Comfrey \
And they clap at the burning sage \
Accidentally lit by the weary father \
Deviation, to Monday, --- \
Is what Monday is truly about.
