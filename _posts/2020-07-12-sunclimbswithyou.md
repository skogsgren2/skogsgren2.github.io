title: The sun climbs with you
---

There is tremendous weariness \\
In wobbly feet on wet stones \\
The blackness below \\
Goes darker as the depth grows. \\
A winter cycles in its width \\
An old man with a towel on his elbow \\
Hangs it on a renovated hook \\
On the wall of the nostalgic Italian place \\

While the beer might taste the same \\
As you walk the line \\
Between laughing & heartfelt goodbyes \\
And you accept the thoughts of \\
Things always change \\
Things always wobble between black & white \\
You can't help but look out toward the street \\
And see your reflection \\
In pools of rain \\

What might have been a dream \\
A long, long time ago \\
As always fades - \\
Clouds in the distance \\
With their enticing forms \\
Become more familiar \\
Than the extension of your soul \\
The water squeezed like a sponge \\
Over a tempest against tin roofs \\
Gradually fades into a steady trickle \\
Gradually fading into white noise. \\

A winding, climbing mountain road \\
Mist rolling in from the waterfalls below \\
From the coldness of early spring rain \\
The night before. \\
As the old jeep you're driving \\
The sun climbs with you \\
Its destination too unknown \\
It's comforting that it too comes and goes. \\
Sam Cooke sings of change on the crackling radio \\
