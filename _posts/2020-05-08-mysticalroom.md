title: Once, in that mystical room
---

Once, in that mystical room \\
Where she inhaled my cheap perfume \\
Where she laughed at every note \\
I said isn't this wonderful \\

Once, in flowery fields \\
No time is lost to the mind \\
The breeze brings feathers \\
From a retired dragon \\

Now, you won't see me \\
I refuse to listen \\
I know what you're thinking \\
Waiting feels like years \\
The waves slowly roll in \\
And I fade away, \\
drifting \\
