title: The West Wind

I'm walking along the breath of the West wind \
That long, winding road \
Being thrown around mercilessly \
By the temperature that moves the needle, \
By the temperament of our joint souls --- \
We that dance at bloody twilights \
And inhale that wind that blows.

While I still sometimes sit, dissatisfied \
At the dark, still, surface of the ocean \
Most days I skip over every wave \
And let myself be carried along by \
The notes contained in every word \
Of every face that has ever known \
How to breathe in the wind that blows. 

The horizon now echoes what goes in inside,  \
There's the pain in waking up alone, red. \
The sound of laughter you've never heard, yellow. \
Fights, wars, blood for a cause, \
Some say the only cause, life through love, purple. \
The joys that make you desire another, blue. \
And of course the eventual leaving, \
Reflected in the wind that blows it all away.

Angels gather around me as I fly effortlessly, \
Perfectly balanced toward the sun, \
Humming the songs of innocence and experience \
On a borrowed set of plastic wings \
They warn me of the approaching storm \
I just laugh. Don't they realize \
That we who suffer together \
Come together to form that very thing, \
That wind that propels us forward?
