title: A burning memory

She told him, once, that his reflection over the water \
Stood ample over her in every situation: \
Alone, in fear, in elation \
Nonetheless in every case comfort without support \
But that burning memory \

A bird flying far above \
Red feathered wings spread wide \
She imagines the cool wind from the ground \
Bouncing of its feathers and \
Like a phoenix in the fire becomes reborn \

Freedom, once grasped is hard to let go \
Even harder is that remembrance \
That escapes times inevitable flow \
Time is but a memory, \
Burning bright, far, far above \
