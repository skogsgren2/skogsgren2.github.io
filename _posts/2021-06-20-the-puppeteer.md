title: The Puppeteer

I dumb it down as to be able to perceive it, \
In pieces it makes no sense, but if, \
If I add them all up they'll deceive me \
And that is the great big secret: \
As the torch is passed on, nothing ever changes, \
Yet the accumulated debt just rises, \
Following the development of our plastic deceivers \
I see it, many others do, but most of us \
Are contained to the limitations of our secrets, \
Secrets that only remain secret \
If we tell our neighbors, who scoff and laugh \
Which in turn turns the turning point toward the burning.

The puppeteer and its master \
Argue over the natural order. \
If the goal is predetermined, \
Presupposed and determined \
By the puppets gangly movements \
Does it matter that its thousand legs \
Don't move without the flick in the wrist \
Of the balding, wise old master? \
So wise that his liver is failing, \
And he blames the puppet, and not the whiskey.

Inexplicable, in a way, \
The synthesis between the most basic \
Of opposing feelings \
How it undulates in broken puzzle pieces \
In scratches on old records, \
Where they sing of contemporary truths \
And in old sonnets, where rhythm \
Is merely assumed, yet crucial. \
In sitting alone by the window, \
Dancing alone by the window, \
The weather changes, the wind always, \
Always blows in the direction \
Of ice & fire, of pieces, of strings \
And it always ends where perception falters \
A shadow that we all know, \
But that we can never see its original object \
Things end at unexpected places.

Does it really matter if I study people, \
If they just keep on changing? \
Just like how the weather in a universe \
Hoping to be analyzed, \
But which retreats from your every move \
Time flows through it to you, \
In pieces to the universe as a whole \
Travel back in an effort to retrieve it, \
Find yourself in the jungle of your own heart \
That is, unless you feel the wind \
Like the plant does to the rain \
Or how drops form oceans, just like a tear.
