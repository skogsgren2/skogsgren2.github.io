title: All of these empty pages
---
All of these empty pages \\
That somehow have flown past above \\
In tender affection the words are held \\
In moments like the one I have in mind \\
The actors, I should say, are well defined \\
Yet the intentions are too black \\
To differentiate from the night \\
There is, of course, the dancer: \\
To whatever comes her way, \\
Uncaring to the stakes \\
Against the backdrop of mistakes \\
There is the forlorn lover \\
Longing for the dancers embrace \\
There is also the soldier \\
Against the court of justice \\
Acting from the word of nature \\
To kill the world of nurture \\

There is the ladies talking about French \\
In English tea rooms. \\

 Yet, somehow, late at night \\
As the clock's rhythm lay steady \\
The heart uneven against it, \\
The empty pages obstruct it, \\
Make the blood to the brain flow slower \\
Than I think it ever did before. \\

The ladies talking about French \\
In English tea rooms \\
Act all surprised at Frankenstein's monster \\
Who gives out his emotions in Iambic pentameter \\
None of them bothered to even look it up, \\
And at this point, does it even matter? \\

In easy evenings far gone, \\
In well received goodbyes, \\
In the actors bowing their heads \\
To the word of feathered pantomimes \\
Their blank pages on their faces \\
Grow obvious to the one above \\
Who sits all well-fed and broken \\
Without any mercy on his mind \\
And what else have they asked of it? \\

But flown alone, above departments \\
Compartmentalized affections, effects unknown \\
To the blank pages which I forgot \\
At least two lifetimes ago; \\
Have life, undoubtedly \\
Have an urge to die, obviously \\
But my act of destruction \\
Grows weak in the face of light \\
Of dimly lit full moon nights \\
