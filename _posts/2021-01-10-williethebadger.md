The days might change, \
And the women might nod too \
The bird will spread its wings \
To the summer too, with its warmth \

A celebration is beyond any communication \
And it must be, following the bar that was set \
To be repaid in the rhythm of the night \
The madonna struggled to her feet again \

This circle of myself, reflecting from dawn \
To twilight in protected, empty rooms \
I hear her laughing in the story above \
She's taken, by the inevitability of the fall \

In the future memory of falsely drawn idols \
I start between the ocean of sword \
And that of the sinful blood --- \
The trumpets blow forcefully, every loss must be my gain \

When I heard you say those words \
I thought part of me understood \
Yet, the shadows still stalk me \
And worse, the voice wakes me up \

In my imagination there's not even someone \
To cash that obsolete check \
My chicken bobs his head to T.S. Eliot \
As he gives the posthumuous Nobel prize \
To Willie the badger \
For describing the human condition
& how it feels as you bob your neck. \
