title: Ruins before ruins before my eyes
---

Ruins before ruins before my eyes \\
The memories play before me \\
It grieves me before its death \\
The sun shines slowly \\
In its watery reflection \\

As the codes by the mount crumble \\
The woman in the green scented suit \\
Screams unanswered, fears nonetheless heard \\
The powerful love hangs by the old book \\
As the band with cracked violins \\
Play the rhythm of nihilistic woes \\
Hanging over the line \\
On the midnight moon \\

Facing it alone... \\
No explanation needs to be said \\
As the horsemen gathered their heads \\
Uniformly selected -- \\
Like the the lover on his pedestal \\
Preaching lovingly to the bird \\
With red streaks over its gentle wings \\
