title: I Go To The Movies, Sometimes.

I go to see a movie starring Robin Williams, \
Laughing throughout, saddened at parts. \
Seeing his eyes I'm inclined to believe him, \
Even though they were drenched, and I am dry.

It rains as I make my exit, and I walk on \
Getting soaked, most definitely, \
But more importantly the whole complacency \
Exhaled from me to the gutter.

And even echoing in the following days \
Of simultaneous ice and fire, \
Confusion, heartlessness and alcohol \
Among the uncontrollable laughter. 

The faces in my constructed web \
Of my own little constellation project \
Start to fade, start to dissipate \
I'm falling, falling out of reality. 

I go to see a movie starring Robin Williams, \
I laugh throughout, I smile to the person next to me \
My own version is reflected in the eyes of other \
Myself is merely a husk gazing straight down.
