His victim, while walking free from his share \\
Was soon to be caught by his glare \\
The reflection in the store's window \\
Bouncing in his soul toward imagined infinity, \\
Toward the dream of absolved loneliness \\
Was enough to dissolve any hint of nervousness \\
She wore a black coat, her hair was too \\
Her eyes told the story of sorrow, and echoed blue \\

There was a familiar key buried someplace deep below \\
Even though she could smell metal in her tired nostrils \\
She imagined it hitting hard against a gravelly road \\
Her interest, of course, was on that road \\
She knew it, he knew it unwillingly \\
The birds sang, the sun sank \\
Coffee smell made its way through caf√© windows \\
Words that almost were uttered echoed to distant Februarys, God too \\

But past those lips his truth was never revealed \\
It rested, written out on his flaky skin \\
His hands still abided faithfully to his rational chains \\
A phoenix is not all that heaven has to offer \\
He knew it, and spoke it, and thought it \\
But his heart was an unused muscle, so he held his words \\
Like the morning star to the evening star, \\
Their goal was the same, only, none knew it yet. \\
