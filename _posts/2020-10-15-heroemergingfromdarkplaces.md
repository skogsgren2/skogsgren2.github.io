title: There is the hero...

There is the hero emerging from dark places \\
Vaulting over trains and rusty iron fences \\
Dragged from his own origin story \\
To one filled with nothing but exemption \\
Yet, somehow, here we are in remembrance \\
Of the memories we crafted \\
Of the places once visited \\
On the money we kept from spending on sprinkles \\

Now as the weather goes away \\
And light reflected returns to space \\
Those memories that some say were wasted \\
Warms the family gatherings \\
Even though he was exempted \\
And no one tries to tell them \\
They help them to save others \\
From those similar dark places \\
