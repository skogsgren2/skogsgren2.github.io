There was something to the smells as she passed by the frozen leaves on the path, something to the crunch in every step she took. There was no way of knowing, only the feeling to absorb. It was raining, and the frost was quickly dissipating from the October morning. Ravens echoed what seemed far above. That she was about to give up seemed even further above. 

The sounds from the headphones talked of hope and what life was about. Her friend screamed out to cold nights through warm drunken roars. The yellow and red in his coats mixed with his red cheeks and red nose. He slipped in front of her on a patch of thin ice as she rushed to his rescue, saying *"C'est la vie"* as she pulled him up. 

*"Thanks Sara"* he blurted out

*"It's Maria"* she said as she put him down. The headphone had slipped out of her ear. There was a new moment, a new beginning. Maybe a new song was all it took. Maybe all it took was a few well picked words. A smile now in the reflected rays of the first morning sun, shone across his face and illuminated his drunken youthful smile. His shaving was half-assed and his haircut was atrocious. His clothing was tattered and way too old for someone as young as he was. But his eyes told his story, and Maria couldn't help but smile.

Some tears escaped in the first rays of that cold October sun.

Years later, as the ravens fly in their usual pattern forevermore. As the newspaper comes rapping periodically at their front door. As the kids skid on make-believe skates on the frozen lake in November. The sun escapes from gray clouds and even longer periods of hiding. There is a moment of hope, there are the words to fill every kind of void.
